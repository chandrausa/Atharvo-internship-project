# House Price Prediction

## Overview

This project implements a machine learning solution to predict house prices based on various features. The goal is to build and evaluate multiple regression models to determine their effectiveness in predicting house prices.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is `Housing.csv`, which includes various features related to house attributes and their prices. The features include but are not limited to house size, number of bedrooms, and location.

## Project Structure

- `housing_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- `Housing.csv`: The dataset used for prediction.
- `README.md`: Documentation file for the project.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
